Version Control System (VCS) or Source Code Manager (SCM): A VCS allows you to: 
revert ﬁles back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, 
review changes made over time, see who last modiﬁed something that might be causing 
a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. 


Commit (snapshot): Git thinks of its data like a set of snapshots of a mini ﬁle system. 
Every time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git, it basically takes a 
picture of what all your ﬁles look like at that moment and stores a reference to that 
snapshot. 


Repository (repo): A directory that contains your project work, as well as a few ﬁles 
(hidden by default in Mac OS X) which are used to communicate with Git. Repositories 
can exist either locally on your computer or as a remote copy on another computer. 


Working Directory: The ﬁles that you see in your computer's ﬁle system. When you 
open your project ﬁles up on a code editor, you're working with ﬁles in the Working 
Directory. 

This is in contrast to the ﬁles that have been saved (in commits!) in the repository. 

When working with Git, the Working Directory is also diﬀerent from the command line's 
concept of the current working directory which is the directory that your shell is 
"looking at" right now. 


Checkout: When content in the repository has been copied to the Working Directory. It 
is possible to checkout many things from a repository; a ﬁle, a commit, a branch, etc. 


Staging Area or Staging Index or Index: A ﬁle in the Git directory that stores 
information about what will go into your next commit. You can think of the staging area 
as a prep table where Git will take the next commit. Files on the Staging Index are 
poised to be added to the repository. 


SHA: A SHA is basically an ID number for each commit. It is a 40-character string 
composed of characters (0–9 and a–f) and calculated based on the contents of a ﬁle or 
directory structure in Git. "SHA" is shorthand for "SHA hash". A SHA might look like this: 
	e2adf8ae3e2e4ed40add75cc44cf9d0a869afeb6 


Branch: A branch is when a new line of development is created that diverges from the 
main line of development. This alternative line of development can continue without 
altering the main line.

.git directory is the brain/storage center for the repository
It holds all of the configuration files and directories and is where all of the commits are stored.

description file - this file is only used by the GitWeb program, so we can ignore it

hooks directory - this is where we could place client-side or server-side scripts that we can use to hook into Git's different lifecycle events

info directory - contains the global excludes file

objects directory - this directory will store all of the commits we make

refs directory - this directory holds pointers to commits (basically the "branches" and "tags")
